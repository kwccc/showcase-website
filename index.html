      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m Kai. I am an aspiring web developer who is passionate about
        learning, creating and collaborating.

      <h2>Why Web Development?</h2>
      <p>
        One of the things I like most about web development is how immediate and
        tangible it is. You think of an idea, write some code, refresh the page
        and instantly see the result. There is also something special about
        turning an idea into something real that people can interact with.

      <h2>Why Founders & Coders?</h2>
      <p>
        At Founders & Coders, I see a strong alignment with my own values:
        collaboration, knowledge-sharing and community-driven learning. I
        started my tech journey in a Fintech company that fostered a friendly
        and supportive environment where it was easy to ask questions and get
        help when stuck. That experience taught me the value of open knowledge
        sharing and how much faster we grow when we learn together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having worked both as a mentor and a learner, I deeply appreciate the
        impact of peer learning and how projects thrive when multiple
        perspectives and skill sets come together. Some of the fastest and most
        effective learning experiences I’ve had have come from working with
        others; whether it’s learning from more experienced developers,
        mentoring those who are just starting out or collaborating to break down
        complex concepts together.

      <h2>What I've learnt so far</h2>
      <p>
        I’ve built a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through
        project based and peer learning. Additionally, my previous experience in
        Fintech has given me a strong background in Git, SQL and testing,
        something I'm keen to share and help others in the group with. Here are
        a couple of projects that I have completed:
      </p>
      <ul>

        <li>

            >Rock Paper Scissors</a

        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What's next?</h2>
      <p>
        I want to continue growing as a developer while actively supporting
        those around me. My goal is to become a well-rounded web developer,
        contributing to exciting projects that make a real impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m eager to be part of a community that thrives on learning together,
        supporting one another and building something greater than the sum of
        its parts.
