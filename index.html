        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I’m Kai. I am an aspiring web developer who is passionate about
          learning, creating and collaborating.

        <h2>Why Web Development?</h2>
        <p>
          One of the things I like most about web development is how quickly you
          can create something and see the progress you are making in your web
          browser. You think of an idea, write some code, refresh the page and
          instantly see the result. I also find it very rewarding to see other
          people use something that I have created. My partner now uses the
          calculator that I built on her phone (although I always tell her to
          double check all calculations!)

        <h2>Why Founders & Coders?</h2>
        <p>
          At Founders & Coders, I see a strong alignment with my own values:
          collaboration, knowledge-sharing and community-driven learning. I
          started my tech journey in a Fintech company that fostered a friendly
          and supportive environment where it was easy to ask questions and get
          help when stuck. That experience taught me the value of open knowledge
          sharing and how much faster we grow when we learn together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having worked both as a mentor and a learner, I deeply appreciate the
          impact of peer learning and how projects thrive when multiple
          perspectives and skill sets come together. Some of the fastest and
          most effective learning experiences I’ve had have come from working
          with others; whether it’s learning from more experienced developers,
          mentoring those who are just starting out or collaborating to break
          down complex concepts together.

        <h2>What I've learnt so far</h2>
        <p>
          I’ve built a solid foundation in HTML, CSS and JavaScript through
          project based and peer learning. Additionally, my previous experience
          in Fintech has given me a strong background in Git, SQL and testing,
          something I'm keen to share and help others in the group with. Here
          are a couple of projects that I have completed:

        </ul>

        <h2>What's next?</h2>
        <p>
          I want to continue growing as a developer while actively supporting
          those around me. My goal is to become a well-rounded web developer,
          contributing to exciting projects that make a real impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m eager to be part of a community that thrives on learning together,
          supporting one another and building something greater than the sum of
          its parts.
