    <h1>Kai</h1>
    <h2>Hi this is my showcase website!</h2>
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I’m Kai, an aspiring web developer passionate about learning, creating
      and collaboration. I started tech journey in a Fintech company that
      fostered a friendly, supportive environment where it was easy to ask
      questions and get help when stuck. That experience taught me the value of
      open knowledge-sharing and how much faster we grow when we learn together.
    </p>
    <h2>Why Web Development?</h2>
    <p>
      One of the things I love most about web development is how immediate and
      tangible it is. You write some code, refresh the page, and instantly see
      the result - it’s incredibly satisfying. There’s something special about
      turning an idea into something real that people can interact with.
    </p>
    <h2>Why Founders & Coders?</h2>
    <p>
      At Founders & Coders, I see a strong alignment with my own values:
      collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and community-driven learning. Having
      worked as both a mentor and a learner, I deeply appreciate the impact of
      peer learning and how projects thrive when multiple perspectives and skill
      sets come together. Some of the fastest and most effective learning
      experiences I’ve had have come from working with others; whether it’s
      learning from more experienced developers, mentoring those who are just
      starting out, or collaborating to break down complex concepts together.
    </p>
    <h2>What I've learnt so far</h2>
    <p>
      Through project based and peer learning I’ve built a solid foundation in
      HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, my previous experience in Fintech
      has given me a strong background in Git, SQL, and testing. Here are a
      couple of projects that I have completed:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Calculator</li>
      <li>Rock Paper Scissors</li>
      <li>Etch-a-sketch</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What's next?</h2>
    <p>
      I want to continue growing as a developer while actively supporting those
      around me. My goal is to become a well-rounded web developer, contributing
      to exciting projects that make a real impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Collaboration is at the heart of great development, and I’m eager to be
      part of a community that thrives on learning together, supporting one
      another, and building something greater than the sum of its parts!
    </p>
